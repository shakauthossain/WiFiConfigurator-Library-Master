Title: Introducing WiFiConfigurator: Simplifying WiFi Connectivity for ESP32 and ESP8266

**Introduction:**
I am thrilled to announce the release of WiFiConfigurator, a groundbreaking Arduino library that aims to simplify WiFi connectivity for ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. After extensive development and testing, I am excited to share this powerful tool with the Arduino community, empowering developers to effortlessly connect their projects to WiFi networks.

**Features:**

* Seamless Integration: WiFiConfigurator allows users to connect ESP32 and ESP8266 MCUs to WiFi networks with just four lines of code, significantly reducing setup time and complexity.
* AP Mode Support: With WiFiConfigurator, connecting to WiFi networks in AP (Access Point) mode is now possible, providing greater flexibility in network configuration.
* Minimalist Design: The library is designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels while ensuring robust and reliable performance.
* Extensive Compatibility: WiFiConfigurator is compatible with Arduino IDE, enabling seamless integration into existing projects and workflows.

**How to Use:**

1. Install WiFiConfigurator and WiFiManger library in your Arduino IDE.
2. Include the WiFiConfigurator header file in your sketch.
3. Initialize WiFiConfigurator and configure your WiFi settings using the provided functions.
4. Connect to WiFi networks with ease using just four lines of code.

**Example Usage:**

    #include <WiFiConfigurator.h>                 //Download the library from https://github.com/shakauthossain/WiFiConfigurator-Library-Master
    
    WiFiConfigurator wifiConfigurator;            // Create an instance of the WiFiConfigurator class
    
    void setup() {
      wifiConfigurator.setup();                   //setup function will make the ESP8266 as an AP Point to take WiFi credentials to connect it with your WiFi
      
      //Your Main Code Here
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // Check if configuration needs to be saved
      if (wifiConfigurator.shouldSaveConfiguration()) {
          wifiConfigurator.resetSaveFlag();       //If the credentials of WiFi is not saved before it will start to make the AP or it will connect to the WiFi automatic
      }
      
      //Your Main Code Here
    
    }

**Conclusion:**
WiFiConfigurator represents a significant advancement in simplifying WiFi connectivity for ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. Whether you are a hobbyist or a professional developer, this library offers a streamlined solution for integrating WiFi capabilities into your projects. I invite you to explore WiFiConfigurator and experience the ease and efficiency it brings to IoT development.
